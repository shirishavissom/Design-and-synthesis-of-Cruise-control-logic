# Design-and-synthesis-of-Cruise-control-logic
Synthesized the RTL Design with a specific library for 180nm technology to build gate-level netlist, performed Pre-layout STA and also designed the SDC constraint. Generated SPEF Files to determine the Parasitic RC of the nets for crosstalk and signoff STA analysis.

Synthesized the RTL Design with a specific library for 180nm technology to build gate-level netlist, performed Pre-layout
STA and also designed the SDC constraint. Performed the entire PD flow and analyzed the routing topology to reduce
congestion. Generated SPEF Files to determine the Parasitic RC of the nets for crosstalk and signoff STA analysis.


Synthesized the logic with a specific library for 180nm technology. Performed Pre-layout static timing analysis of the synthesized design.
Designed constraints for the cruise design and timing of all the paths in the design were analyzed. Performed the "Placing and Routing " the circuit on a die using the synthesized Verilog netlist generated for the cruise control logic design.
