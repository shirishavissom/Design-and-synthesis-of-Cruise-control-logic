# Design-and-synthesis-of-Cruise-control-logic
Synthesized the RTL Design with a specific library for 180nm technology to build gate-level netlist, performed Pre-layout STA and also designed the SDC constraint. Generated SPEF Files to determine the Parasitic RC of the nets for crosstalk and signoff STA analysis.
